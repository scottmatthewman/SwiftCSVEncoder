# SwiftCSVEncoder

A Swift package that allows for creation of CSV files.

## Rationale

Neither Swift nor Apple's application libraries contain a standardised method of converting data to CSV format for export. A number of packages already exist, but I wanted to build my own minimal-but-reusable library.

## Features

1. **Not coupled to root object structure.**

   `Codable` is great, but is limited to a single coding representation per object. It's also created with hierarchical representations â€“ dictionaries and arrays inside other dictionaries or arries - in mind, whereas CSV is by its nature flat in structure.
   
    I also need CSV outputs with different columns for different purposes, so SwiftDSVEncoder provides a `CSVTable` object that defines which columns to use:

   ```swift
   let table: CSVTable<Customer> = CSVTable(
     columns: [
       CSVColumn("Name") { $0.name },
       CSVColumn("Email") { $0.email },
       CSVColumn("Order count") { $0.orders?.count ?? 0 }
     ]
   )
   ```

2. **Always include column headers as the first row.**

3. **Automatic quoting of strings, but only when needed.**

   Including freeform text in CSVs is fraught with difficulties, because not all CSV importers handle things like new lines or embedded special characters (`"`, `,`) in the same way. SwiftCSVEncoder currently supports only one set of encoding rules for strings:

   * If the text includes a comma (`,`), a newline (`\n`) or double quotes (`"`), or if it has leading or trailing whitespace, then the whole string is enclosed in double quotation marks.
   * Any double quotes within the text are escaped by being doubled, so the text `This is C.S.Lewis's sequel to "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"` would be emitted as `"This is C.S.Lewis's sequel to ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"""`.

4. **Default delimiter and line-ending**

  The CSVs emitted by SwiftCSVEncoder separate fields only by commas. Each line is terminated by a `\n` character. If you want different options, then (for now) look elsewhere.

5. **Optional control over `Date` format**

  `Date` objects are natively handled, but the format in which they are converted to strings might vary. Each `CSVTable` supports a configuration object that includes a `dateEncodingStrategy`. The default is to use a full date/time ISO 8601-compliant format.

6. **Only support in-memory data creation**

   `SwiftCSVEncoder` only cerates a string representation of the whole CSV file in memory. The calling aplication needs to handle saving the data to an appropriate location. This means that is more appropriate for small datasets; larger files may require more efficient methods of storing a persistent copy of the CSV data.
